                    Misplaced or Private account orders will not qualify for a refund. Be sure to confirm each and every
                    order before placing it. Fraudulent activity such as using unauthorized or stolen credit cards will
                    lead
                    to termination of your account. Please do not use more than one server at the same time for the same
                    page. We cannot give you correct followers/likes number in that case. We will not refund for these
                    orders.
                    Funds received under the referral program cannot be transferred (transferred) to another advertising
                    account.
                    The Service does NOT make a refund if the order is made for a closed / private account, as well as
                    when
                    hiding information about statistics and counter, when creating an order - be careful.
                    The Service does NOT make a refund when content is deleted or when a special restriction is imposed
                    by
                    the social network.

                    Affiliate and referral programs
                    The Service provides its own affiliate and referral programs for partners.
                    Every user can use the Service’s affiliate program. User can take our ready-to-use code on our
                    website,
                    set margin and place widget on different web-sites. The user earns on the margin that he sets
                    himself.
                    Every user can use the Service's referral program. User can work with our platform and get a certain
                    percentage from all spendings of invited referrals.
                    Referrals attracted by a user and having one IP address and a single digital footprint with the user
                    will not be considered as attracted referrals.
                    The Service is not responsible for the data inserted into the code by third parties. The Service
                    only
                    provides the code for public use. Responsibility for any modification of the code is borne by the
                    second
                    party not associated with The Service.
                    An Affiliate can request a payment when their balance reaches a minimum balance of $50 USD. Payments
                    can
                    be requested every 30 days. Payment processing can take up to 30 days from the request date.
                    The Service works with different payment services. You can use it for payment requests.
                    The Service reserves the right to change the terms of affiliate and referral programs at any time.
                    For
                    more information about margin, payments, codes of affiliate and referral programs you can visit
                    programs
                    pages.
                    The user will receive a percentage (set by the Service) from all the spending of his referrals minus
                    the
                    cost of replenishment and refunds.

                    Advertisers hereby agree not to contact websites in the Company’s Ads Network in order to purchase
                    advertising space from them or engage in practice that would be deemed competitive to the efforts of
                    the
                    Company in its attempts to represent the website’s advertising spaces. Violation of this clause
                    shall be
                    deemed a material breach of this Contract.
                    Confidentiality
                    Each Party (a “Receiving Party”) understands that the other Party (a “Disclosing Party”) may
                    disclose
                    information of a confidential nature including, without limitation, product information, data,
                    pricing,
                    financial information, software, specifications, research and development and proprietary algorithms

                    other materials that is disclosed in a manner in which the Disclosing Party reasonably communicated,
                    or
                    the Receiving Party should reasonably have understood under the circumstances that the disclosure
                    should
                    be treated as confidential, whether or not the specific designation “confidential” or any similar
                    designation is used (“Confidential Information”).
                    The Receiving Party agrees, for itself and its agents and employees, that it will not publish,
                    disclose
                    or otherwise divulge or use for its own purposes any Confidential Information of the Disclosing
                    Party
                    furnished to it by such Disclosing Party without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party
                    in
                    each instance. Neither party will make any public announcement regarding the existence or content of
                    the
                    Agreement without the other’s prior written approval.
                    The Parties agree that if disclosure is made to their professional advisors, auditors or bankers
                    this
                    shall be done subject to each Party procuring each such recipient’s agreement to keep such
                    information
                    confidential to the same extent as if such recipient were Party to this agreement.
                    The foregoing obligations under this section 11 shall not extend to any information to the extent
                    that
                    the Receiving Party can demonstrate that such information (i) was at the time of disclosure or, to
                    the
                    extent that such information thereafter becomes through no fault of the Receiving Party, a part of
                    the
                    public domain by publication or otherwise; (ii) was already properly and lawfully in the Receiving
                    Party’s possession at the time it was received by the Receiving Party free from any obligation of
                    confidentiality, (iii) was or is lawfully received by the Receiving Party from a third Party who was
                    under no obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party with respect thereto, or (iv) is
                    independently developed by the Receiving Party or its independent contractors who did not have
                    access to
                    the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information or (v) express written consent has been given prior
                    to
                    disclosure.
                    In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information in accordance
                    with judicial or regulatory or governmental order or requirement, or any tax authority to which that
                    Party is subject or submits, wherever situated, whether or not the requirement for information has
                    the
                    force of law the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party in order to allow such
                    Party
                    to contest the order or requirement or seek confidential treatment for such information.
                    Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, upon the request of a Disclosing Party, the
                    Receiving
                    Party agrees to return to the other all of such other Party’s Confidential Information, or to
                    certify to
                    the Disclosing Party in writing that all such material has been destroyed, however, destruction is
                    only
                    permitted after Disclosing Party’s prior approval.

                    Either party may cancel the ads campaign and terminate the present Agreement with 48 hours’ written
                    notice to the other party.
                    The Company shall be entitled, with immediate effect, to stop Advertiser’s Campaign or to
                    prematurely

                    agreed fees or any other remuneration to the Company within a stated time; (e) Advertiser otherwise
                    fails to comply with this Agreement and such breach of contract is material; or (f) Advertiser is
                    placed
                    into insolvent liquidation or is otherwise insolvent.
                    In this case, the Company shall have the right to block your account immediately and to withhold the

                    in this Agreement.
                    Force Majeure
                    The force majeure events are understood as events which occur after the Effective Date, regardless
                    of
                    the will of the Parties, and which could not be foreseen and prevented by any reasonable actions of
                    the
                    Parties. The influence of these events may postpone the performance of all or several parts of
                    present
                    Agreement or other terms and conditions agreed by the Parties.
                    The circumstances of force majeure include such events as war, mobilization, epidemic, fire, natural
                    disasters, traffic accidents and changes in legislation, if such events meet the criteria of this
                    Agreement. The list above is not exhaustive.
                    If provision of Services was postponed due to the force majeure, the Party affected by force majeure
                    shall notify the other Party in writing about the day of the force majeure commencement within 5
                    calendar days. With the cessation of force majeure and the restoration of normal conditions, the
                    Party
                    which was affected by force majeure shall notify the other Party in writing within 3 calendar days.
